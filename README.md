# Neural Markov Logic Networks


## Installation

Just run:

    pip intall -e ./


## Run experiments

The experiments are in two folders:

- `kbc`, where we included the experiments for the Knowledge Base completion tasks
- `molecules`, where we included the experiments for the Molecule Generation task.

To run an experiment, just run the corresponding script from the folder, e.g.

    cd molecules
    python generation_with_constraints.py



Hyperparameters can be set directly in the corresponding scripts.
